# Lipslut

Lipslut uses Gatsby.

For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/).

During my time with Faneron Inc., I created some awesome data visualization of sales per state. The visualization is dynamically updated everytime the site is built. Sales data is compiled through a script ran through Node and then that data is parsed into Gatsby.
