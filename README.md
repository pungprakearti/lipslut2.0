During my time with Faneron Inc., I created some awesome data visualization of sales per state. The visualization is dynamically updated everytime the site is built. Sales data is compiled through a script ran through Node and then that data is parsed into Gatsby.

I also created an ingredients list and pop up modal using data fetched from the Contentful API using GraphQL.
